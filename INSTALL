===================== INSTALLATION OF FIGURE LIBRARY =====================

1. Possibility (ADVISED):
To install the Figure library correctly with CMake follow these steps:
(Make sure you have CMake installed!)

Linux/Mac:
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake ..
   $ sudo make install

Windows:
   Almost same procedure as above:
   - open a terminal with administrator rights
   - do the same as above but without the 'sudo'

You're done now! Ignore the rest of this file.

2. Possibility:
In the directory where "figure.hpp" and "figure.cpp" are, do:

1. $ ar ruc libFigure.a figure.hpp
   $ ranlib libFigure.a

2. Move libFigure.a to the directory where you keep your libraries (usually /usr/local/lib)
   and figure.hpp to the directory of your includes (usually /usr/local/includes)

You're done now.
